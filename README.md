# AppCar

## Welcome to AppCar

To initialize the application it is important to know the following:

 - The Backend application (Spring) runs in the port 8080
 - The Frontend aplication (Angular) runs in the port 4200
 - To start Angular, use the following command: `npm start` instead of `ng serve`. This is to enable CORS permissions to make Http request between local servers
